## 🏥 SERVICE TYPE ANALYSIS

### By Event Type:

| Service Event Type | Total Claims | Approved | Approval Rate | Total Billed |
|--------------------|--------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **ICSE** (Inpatient) | 282 | 164 | 58.16% | SAR 1,076,164.88 |
| **SCSE** (Same Day) | 88 | 53 | 60.23% | SAR 50,229.95 |

## ❌ REJECTION ANALYSIS

### Total Rejected Claims: 55 (10.51% of all claims)

#### Breakdown by Rejection Type:

| Type | Count | Percentage of Rejections | Total Amount | Avg per Claim |
|------|-------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Cancelled** | 26 | 47.27% | SAR 561,271.89 | SAR 21,587.38 |
| **Rejected** | 18 | 32.73% | SAR 58,089.46 | SAR 3,227.19 |
| **Error** | 11 | 20.00% | SAR 62,270.02 | SAR 5,661.09 |

### 🚨 Critical Issue: Cancellations

**26 cancelled claims = SAR 561,271.89 (64% of total loss!)**

#### Why This Matters:
- Average cancelled claim value: **SAR 21,587** (10x higher than rejections!)
- Cancelled claims are typically **high-value inpatient cases**
- These were likely **pre-authorized** then cancelled - suggests:
  1. Eligibility issues discovered after admission
  2. Authorization expiry
  3. Documentation problems
  4. Clinical necessity disputes

## 💎 HIGH-VALUE CLAIMS (> SAR 5,000)

### Overview:
- **Total High-Value Claims:** 48 (9.17% of all claims)
- **Represent:** 59% of total billed amount (SAR 687,000 of SAR 1.16M)
- **Problem:** 35 out of 48 (72.9%) are rejected/cancelled/error

## 💰 TOP 10 REJECTED HIGH-VALUE CLAIMS

| Rank | Transaction ID | Amount | Status | Date | Insurer |

| **TOTAL** | **TOP 10** | **SAR 332,345.21** | - | - | - |

### 🔍 Pattern Discovered:
**ALL TOP 10 REJECTIONS ARE FROM CNHI (INSURER)**

This is suspicious! GlobeMed Saudi is the **Third-Party Administrator (TPA)**, but **CNHI is the actual insurer**. 
The cancellations suggest a **specific issue with CNHI policies** processed through GlobeMed.

## 💡 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: **Mass Cancellations on April 24 & 27**

**Potential Causes:**
1. **Eligibility System Failure:** Hospital's eligibility checker may have been broken (remember: 99.9% failure rate in overall analysis)
2. **CNHI Authorization Expiry:** Bulk authorization might have expired April 10
3. **Policy Changes:** CNHI may have changed coverage rules mid-month
4. **Billing System Error:** Wrong policy numbers or identifiers submitted
5. **Bulk Submission Error:** Technical issue with batch processing

**Evidence:**
- All cancelled claims are CNHI (through GlobeMed TPA)
- All cancellations happened **after April 10**
- High-value inpatient claims most affected
- No approvals at all after April 10

### Issue #2: **75% Loss Rate (Only 24.5% Recovery)**

**Potential Causes:**
1. **Partial Approvals:** 36.7% of claims only partially paid
   - Service bundling issues
   - Pricing above approved tariff
   - Clinical necessity not established

2. **High Cancellation Rate:** 4.97% cancelled (vs 1-2% industry standard)
   - Eligibility issues
   - Authorization problems

3. **Claim Submission Quality:** 
   - Missing documentation
   - Incorrect coding
   - Incomplete information

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Eligibility system failure** led to treating ineligible patients
2. **No real-time alerts** for high-value claim issues
3. **Mass submission on April 24** without verification
4. **Poor documentation** for complex inpatient cases
5. **No follow-up** on partial approvals (lost revenue)

### What to Do Differently:
1. ✅ **Always verify eligibility** before admission
2. ✅ **Pre-authorize all claims > SAR 5,000**
3. ✅ **Don't batch-submit** without quality checks
4. ✅ **Track claims daily** - catch issues early
5. ✅ **Appeal everything** - recover partial shortfalls

---

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

### The Good News:
- ✅ GlobeMed approval rate (52.77%) is **above hospital average** (50.9%)
- ✅ Most claims are routine and process smoothly
- ✅ Clear patterns identified - fixable problems
- ✅ **SAR 370k+ immediate recovery potential**

### The Challenge:
- 🔴 **Only 24.5% recovery rate** - SAR 75 of every SAR 100 lost
- 🔴 **April 24/27 mass cancellations** - SAR 578k at risk
- 🔴 **High-value claims struggling** - 73% rejection rate
- 🔴 **Partial approvals** - SAR 157k shortfall not recovered

### The Opportunity:
- 💰 **SAR 370k short-term recovery** (appeals)
- 💰 **SAR 525k monthly improvement** (process fixes)
- 💰 **SAR 6.3M annual benefit** (sustainable improvements)

### Bottom Line:
**This is fixable, measurable, and highly profitable!**

The April 24/27 cancellations appear to be a **one-time systemic issue** (likely eligibility system failure). If we:
1. Appeal the cancellations
2. Fix the eligibility system
3. Improve documentation quality
4. Implement proper pre-authorization

We can realistically achieve **70% recovery rate** (vs current 24.5%), generating **SAR 6.3M+ annually**.

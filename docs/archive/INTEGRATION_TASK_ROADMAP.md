**Risk 2: Performance Degradation** üü° MEDIUM
- **Description:** Large data volumes (359 rows currently, could grow to 100K+) may impact query performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement database indexing, query optimization, caching strategy
- **Contingency:** Consider sharding, read replicas, or time-series database for historical data

**Risk 3: Integration Complexity** üî¥ HIGH
- **Description:** Merging two complex systems (GIVC + OASIS+) may reveal unforeseen architectural conflicts
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout with pilot testing, comprehensive integration tests, rollback strategy
- **Contingency:** Maintain systems separately with data sync bridge if full integration proves too risky

**Risk 4: Stakeholder Alignment** üü° MEDIUM
- **Description:** Different teams may have conflicting priorities or requirements
- **Mitigation:** Regular stakeholder workshops, clear RACI matrix, executive sponsorship
- **Contingency:** Escalation path to executive leadership for decision-making

## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision 1: Hybrid Database Strategy** ‚úÖ APPROVED
- **Date:** October 22, 2025
- **Decision:** Use MongoDB for operational data (speed), PostgreSQL for analytics (complex queries)
- **Rationale:** Leverages existing OASIS+ MongoDB, adds analytical capabilities, allows independent scaling
- **Alternatives Considered:** Single PostgreSQL (complex migrations), Single MongoDB (weak analytics)

**Decision 2: Message Bus Technology** ‚úÖ APPROVED
- **Date:** October 22, 2025
- **Decision:** Use Redis + Celery for async task processing
- **Rationale:** Proven technology, Python ecosystem, low latency, horizontal scaling
- **Alternatives Considered:** RabbitMQ (more complex), Azure Service Bus (vendor lock-in), Kafka (overkill for volume)

**Decision 3: Phased Rollout Strategy** ‚úÖ APPROVED
- **Date:** October 22, 2025
- **Decision:** Pilot with MOH + TAWUNIYA, then expand to all payers
- **Rationale:** These represent 65% of data volume, different complexity levels, geographically distributed
- **Alternatives Considered:** Big bang (too risky), Single payer pilot (not representative)

### Open Questions

**Question 1: Payer Adapter Ownership** ‚ùì PENDING
- **Issue:** Who maintains payer-specific adapters when payer APIs change?
- **Options:** Centralized team vs. distributed ownership
- **Decision Needed By:** Week 2
- **Stakeholders:** Engineering Lead, Business Development

**Question 2: MOH Rules Governance** ‚ùì PENDING
- **Issue:** Who approves changes to MOH validation rules?
- **Options:** Medical coding team vs. RCM operations vs. compliance
- **Decision Needed By:** Week 3
- **Stakeholders:** Compliance Officer, RCM Manager

**Question 3: Data Retention Policy** ‚ùì PENDING
- **Issue:** How long to retain historical rejection data?
- **Options:** 1 year, 3 years, 7 years (compliance requirement)
- **Decision Needed By:** Week 4
- **Stakeholders:** Legal, Compliance, IT

**Question 4: Production Hosting** ‚ùì PENDING
- **Issue:** Azure vs. AWS vs. on-premises for production deployment?
- **Options:** Azure (existing OASIS+), AWS (potentially cheaper), on-prem (data sovereignty)
- **Decision Needed By:** Week 2
- **Stakeholders:** CTO, CFO, Compliance
